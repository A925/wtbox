Web Testing Box: Selenium WebDriver 2.0 Java best practices project. 

This project shows Selenium WebDriver best practices, and provides easy to uses tools for the practices.  
It is currently written in Java.  You are welcome to fork to other languages.  




Teach WebDriver 2.0 best practices in 10 minutes
------------------------------------------------

Our project goal is to show each of the following best practices in 10 minues:  
 
1.	PageObject
2.	Use CSS selector
3.	Wait: ImplicitWaits, WebDriverWait, and Ajax wait
4.	Behavior Driven testing






WebDriver Testing Tools
------------------------
Wish lists: Here are the tools I would like to add

1.	HTML5_Tool: helps navigate, drag and drop, and work with 3rd party JavaScript Unit testing library (such as Qunit).
2.	Excel tool for reading and writing testcases
3.	Take screenshot tool for errors
4.	File tool for reading the test setting properties.


Project Goals
-------------

1.	Show and teach a lesson in 10 minutes (simple and effective)
2.	Easy to learn and use – so even a tester with little programming background can use it
	(Java is a good language for web development, but it is not the popular web development solution compare to php or ruby.  Because most Java web solutions are towards for enterprise applications (humongous, and require steep learning curve to learn).   
         However our testing project is for an average tester not for a developer.  So, let’s make easy, less technical but more practical for testing job done.)   

3.	For advanced topics: just provide information links in the further reading section.
